# blockchain-demo
Repo containing all the solidity code behind the blockchain demo site

The current implementation assumes you're not connected to the Ethereum network<br><br>
    The Demo would cost ether to use as it requires uploading data to the blockchain (albeit very little)<br><br>
    Chrome does not support web3.js, a plugin required for most blockchain applications<br><br>
    To do the demo live on the network it would be a multistep, coming soon....
