# blockchain-demo
Repo containing all the solidity code behind the blockchain demo site

  >The Demo would cost ether to use as it requires uploading data to the blockchain (albeit very little)
  >Chrome does not support web3.js, a plugin required for most blockchain applications
  >To do the demo live on the network it would be a multistep, coming soon....
